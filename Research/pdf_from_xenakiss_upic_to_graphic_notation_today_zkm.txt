THE DIGITAL
INSTRUMENT
AS AN ARTIFACT
INTRODUCTION

MARCIN PIETRUSZEWSKI

At first, the computer program is neutral and exists only in terms devoid
of any reference other than to itself. The program is its function. It is a
tool. It does something; it instructs a computer to perform a task. Its
working is often imperceptible beyond the surface of its interface—screen
based or physical—and its material extension to the inner depths of
its digital structure, the code. Reduced to its substance, being digital
consists of one of two binary values, either 0 or 1—the bit—and its
multiples, the byte. These elementary values cannot by themselves
constitute an object of reflection; as Guerino Mazzola points out “The
digital age is not centered around ‘bits and bytes’ but around their
accessibility and handling.”[1] Opening up the contents of the software
and exposing its inner working enables theorizing about the relationships
within the code itself, the coding architecture, the functioning of the code,
and specific programming choices or expressions, upon which the code
acts, outputs, processes, and represents.
However, focusing solely on a functional aspect of software limits
our engagement with its wider assemblage of connotations. Beyond the
functional and ostensible neutrality of its interface the software is an
artifact, as Matthew Fuller points out: “software creates sensoriums” and
participates in constructing “ways of seeing, knowing and doing in the
world.”[2] The software both contains a model of a world it ostensibly
pertains to and it also shapes the world each time it is used. Subrata
Dasgupta defines artifacts as “useful things that are produced or consciously
conceived in response to some practical need, want or desire.”[3]
With the UPIC (Unité Polyagogique Informatique de CEMAMu) Iannis
Xenakis operationalized a multiscale approach to sound composition within
a standard user interface. An incessant interpolation between temporal
resolutions of the micro, meso, and macro scales[4] constituted a vital feature
of the vision behind the UPIC. The system incorporated a particular view of
sound composition which moved beyond the theory of Fourier[5] and took
as a starting point the pressure versus time curve together with a sound
conceived as quantum; a “phonon” imagined already by Einstein in 1910.[6,7]
Xenakis’s ambition was “to take possession of the sound in a more conscious
and thorough manner,” to conceive “the material of sound” as composable.[8]

614

The design of the UPIC mobilized a correlative gestural and conceptual
exploration of the temporal, physical, and perceptual parameters of sound.
In my practice as a composer and researcher, I have been developing a
computer program called the New Pulsar Generator (nuPG).[9] The program
produces a form of synthesis called pulsar synthesis; its design draws upon
and extends the original Pulsar Generator (PG) application by Curtis Roads
and Alberto de Campo as described in the publications Microsound[10] and
“Sound Composition with Pulsars.”[11] The technique generates a complex
hybrid of sounds across the perceptual time span between infrasonic
pulsations and audio frequencies, giving rise to a broad family of musical
structures: singular impulses, sequences, continuous tones, time-varying
phrases, and beating textures. Through its inherently multiscale character,
pulsar synthesis proposes a unique view on rhythm moving beyond a linear
series of points and intervals tied to a time grid, and introduces a notion of
rhythm as a continuously flowing temporal substrate. Both PG and nuPG
relate to the UPIC through their graphical parametrization of synthesis
data and systematic approach to composition across multiple temporal
levels; an attempt at fusion between micro and macro scales. The study of
pragmata of these systems and a reflection on their sonic output provokes
many fundamental questions about computing, listening and understanding,
creation, interaction, and computer music aesthetics.
This article aims to display how engaging with a digital instrument—
particular qualities and propensities of its design, functional and conceptual
encapsulation of sound and composition theories—contributes to a
mediated model of creative music practice. Such an approach fits within a
broader perspective viewing technology and its objects beyond their merely
functional and instrumental roles, but as mediators of human experiences
and practices.[12] Taking a comparative approach in which the UPIC and the
nuPG systems are engaged with as tools of a particular epistemic modality, I
propose a concept of an “epistemic tool” to further contextualize a practice
of composing with computers in a current multiply-mediated musical reality.[13]
I shall focus on a particular epistemic perspective prescribed within
the design of the UPIC, an integration between conceptual, sound and
visual realms under a notion of multitemporal sound composition. I
propose a parallel narrative of the UPIC and nuPG that display an osmosis
of concepts and technologies of design. Throughout, key themes of this
text are composition across multiple timescales and computer program as
an artifact.
THE UPIC AND A MULTITEMPORAL PARADIGM

A key idea behind the UPIC was that everything in the composition could
be solved in the time domain by working out various shapes, such as

waveforms, pitch curves, and dynamic envelopes. This concept, also
called “graphical synthesis”[14] can be linked back to early experiments in
optical synthesis from the early twentieth century.[15]
When working with the UPIC, the user is confronted with a clean
slate, a tabula rasa; the system is mute and to generate sound it
requires input. The whole aspect of compositional labor—requiring the
user to specify objects from the microstructure of sound, its dynamic
development in time, and to the overall form of the composition—should
be seen as an intentional aesthetic and conceptual stance.[16] At the
level of sound microstructure, the user specifies the waveform and a
shape of the dynamic envelope, which together can be thought of as an
elemental timbre of the instrument. At a higher level of organization, the
user operates the music page function, drawing shapes—lines, curves,
and points, called arcs—on a frequency (vertical) versus time (horizontal)
axis.[17] FIG. 1
These drawn shapes need to be assigned to previously specified
timbres. However, up to this point each input to the system—the waveform,
envelope, and frequency time shapes on a page—exist only as a simple
drawing. To use a Xenakian notion, these shapes exist outside-of-time—they
lack temporal boundaries. By defining a duration (or multiple divisions of it)
for the page, the user decides how to temporalize these drawings: how to
bring the outside-of-time abstract shapes into-time. Only when the duration
is defined are these shapes then converted to music waves.
An essential aspect of UPIC’s setup are the editing capabilities
that each of the arcs could be subjected to: the user can cut, copy, and
paste individual shapes, and compress or stretch them in time and
frequency. An example of all these procedures can be found in Xenakis’s
UPIC composition (1978), which consists of arborescent shapes, cut and
pasted, compressed and stretched in time and frequency.[18] The reading
position and direction on a page and between pages can be variable, too.
As observed by Curtis Roads,[19] arcs written to a page with a duration of a
second become a characteristic of the sound’s microstructure. An opposite
manipulation is possible as well; the microstructural pressure versus time
curve can be stretched in time and used as a structuring element at meso
or macro time levels.
The uniform treatment of composition data and objects at every
level mobilizes a creative grafting across and between the micro, meso,
and macro time resolutions, a dialectical couplet of local and global
perspectives. The design of the UPIC favored a flexible work between
two strands of conceptualization: the inductive—a bottom-up glueing
of the elemental into the global—and a deductive—a top-down carving
of the whole into smaller parts. As such, the UPIC might be described

617

MARCIN PIETRUSZEWSKI

as a system of "transparent stratification" rendering entirely open for a
pendular process of differentiation and reintegration of sound materials
and forms at all the levels of temporal organization.[20] Such a bimodal
process problematizes the duality between form and material: the same
object can be conceived as material or form (substance or container)
depending on the level of investigation.[21]
The design of the UPIC extended the temporal field of compositional
activity and attempted to functionalize a multiscale approach to musical
form. To operate within a full register of timescales is to shift the aesthetic
focus away from discrete sound entities occupying well-defined time frames
towards continuous and evolving objects with fuzzy boundaries. These new
objects rarely conform to traditional angular forms of musical structure, and
tend toward cloud-like evaporative and continuously evolving morphologies.
The multiscale approach favors flexibility, as Curtis Roads points out: it
mediates between a high-level abstract plan (the top-down global structure)
and opportunities emerging from a low-level of sound material operations
(the bottom-up local structures). All temporal levels are to be composed;
at any time in the compositional process, we can intervene by synthesis
and transformation at any timescale, from a macro scale of the whole
work, down to sections, phrases, sound objects, grains, and even individual
samples.[22] A dialectic of inductive and deductive processes, observed
within the workings of UPIC, forms a key characteristic of the multiscale
composition approach: to approach musical composition from a multiscale
perspective is to allow an interplay between inductive (specific and local)
and deductive (general and global) thinking. These issues are pertinent to
the theory and practice of pulsar synthesis.

As an integral part of my artistic research practice, I have been involved
in a systematic exploration of the technique of pulsar synthesis. Over
the past two decades, the technique of pulsar synthesis and its various
software instrument implementation—such as, Pulsar Generator (2000)
by Curtis Roads and Alberto de Campo, Pulsar Generator (2004) by Tommi
Kerannen and Particularity (2010) by Chris Jeffs—acted as a material point
of connection, linking practitioners in and outside research institutions.
Whether as input sound material for further processing,[23] a raw synthetic
output,[24] or as a model for auditory display of data,[25] the practice of
pulsar synthesis activated discourse in a variety of functional, aesthetic,
and conceptual contexts.
The technique of pulsar synthesis is a powerful approach to digital
sound synthesis; it is named after a highly magnetized rotating neutron star
that emits a beam of electromagnetic radiation at a frequency between

FIG. 2 A workspace of the Pulsar Generator program designed by Curtis Roads and
Alberto de Campo in 2000, 2019, screenshot. Notice the complexity of the pulsaret and
the envelope tables, as well as the variation in fundamental frequency and three sets of
formant frequencies, panning, and amplitude trajectories. These could be designed in
advance of synthesis, or manipulated in real time as the instrument plays. The program
implemented a scheme for saving and loading these envelopes in groups called
settings. The program lets one crossfade at a variable rate between multiple settings,
which takes performance with Pulsar Generator to another level of synthesis complexity.

0.25 and 642 Hz.[26] Pulsar synthesis operationalizes the notion of rhythm
with its multitemporal affordances as a system of interconnected patterns
evolving on multiple time scales.
The fundamental functional unit at the microstructure level in pulsar
synthesis is called a pulsar. A spectrum of a single pulsar is a result of a
convolution between pulsaret and envelope. The pulsaret table can be
considered “a template of spectrum shape,”[27] while the envelope is a
function limiting it in time. An important generalization is that both tables,
pulsaret waveform and envelope tables, can be any shape. A repetition
of the pulsaret forms a pulsar train; a stream of pulses emitted at a
user-stipulated rate which can vary from infrasonic pulsations to audio
frequencies.
Developed in 2000 by Curtis Roads and Alberto de Campo, the PG
program generalized the technique of pulsar synthesis and provided a
powerful interface to control its various parameters.[28]
As part of my ongoing PhD research at the University of Edinburgh, I
have been developing a new version of the historic PG. The nuPG program
is developed in SuperCollider 3 programming language and incorporates
an extensive set of graphic interface tools to control various parameters
of synthesis.[29] Additionally, the underlying Just-In-Time programming
paradigm[30] used in the development of the program means that all
objects of the nuPG can be redefined in real time. A coupling between
graphic and textual interfaces allows for powerful control of visual and
formalized compositional models.
At the microstructure of the sound the New Pulsar Generator
provides a set of tools to manipulate the shape of the pulsaret waveform.
FIG. 4 The shape can be also generated using a harmonic or the
Chebyshev shaper function FIG. 5. The waveform has a fundamental effect
on the spectral shape of the generated pulsar stream.
Foundational for the discussion on the digital musical instrument
design is the concept of representation.[31] Roads and Wieneke[32]
distinguish between iconic (also called analog) and symbolic
representations. “A sign is said to be iconic when there is a topological
similarity between the signifier (the sign) and its denotata (i.e., what it
represents).” A sequence of numbers stored in the memory of a computer
corresponding in value to the shape of an acoustic signal is one example
of such representation. “A sign without either similarity or contiguity but
only a conventional link between its signifier and denotata is called a
symbol.”[33] A syntactic arrangement of symbols plays a functional role
within formal languages. Such symbols do not usually mirror the surface
structure of a composition; rather, they represent the “background”
interrelations or “deep structure.”

allows for saving and interpolating between waveforms. © Marcin Pietruszewski

The question of iconic versus symbolic, discrete versus continuous, as
well as graphical versus textual representation of musical information is a
perennial issue in the context of digital instrument design.
THE DIGITAL INSTRUMENT AS AN ARTIFACT

As a way of synthesizing the discussion about UPIC, PG, and nuPG I
propose to expand the notion of digital instrument as an artifact. the UPIC,
as well as PG and nuPG programs, as any other piece of human-made
technology, do not function in a vacuum. As Anne Sauvagnargues points
out:
A tool or a machine should not be studied in isolation without taking
into consideration the milieu of individuation that surrounds it and
allows it to function. No machine or technical tool exists by itself [...]
they only function in an assembled milieu of individuation, which
constitutes their conditions of possibility: there is no hammer without
a nail, and thus the interaction between a multitude of technical
objects makes the fabrication of hammers and nails possible, while
also forming the conditions of their utilisation and the practices and
habits associated with them.[34]
Systematic engagement with an artifact must acknowledge its
constituent multiplicity and contexts activated via its use. Artifacts are
complex conglomerates of things and composition of “components, which
are continuously rearranged and reassembled in their specific modes of
appearance throughout history”.[35] Artifacts are “like organisms, they
manifest evolution.”[36] Any artifact is surrounded by the knowledge that is
prior to its emergence and also by the knowledge that appears only after
the artifact was made.
Every artifact generates an interpretative cut. With a particular
perspective prescribed within its design and function, UPIC, PG, and nuPG
can all be thought of encapsulations of knowledge and carriers of a sound
theory. Moreover, engaging with such instruments is not limited only to
interaction with their physical dimension—the interface. These instruments
engage their user with a prescription of a compositional model; a projection
which embodies a particular epistemological perspective of what is to be
composed: what is the material, its possible transformation and formal
organization. By mediating their compositional model, UPIC, PG, and nuPG
framed the boundaries of perception and thought.
Don Ihde conceptualized a variety of phenomenological modalities of
instruments and their role in our relationship with the world. Among these
are embodied relations, where the instrument acts as an extension of the
body and amplification of the senses; and hermeneutic relations, where

the instrument provides us with data (e.g., a sonogram) which we have to
interpret (from Greek hermēneuein, interpret.)[37]
The underlying design technology of UPIC, PG, and nuPG correlates
the embodied and hermeneutical within one design based on a bimodal
evolution between gestural and conceptual. All the systems incorporated
embodied relation; the UPIC especially, through its corporeal interface
relying on the drawing capacity of the human hand and the proportion of a
CAD/CAM drawing board, ergonomically designed to follow the proportions
of the human body.[38] The ability to use the various objects (a waveform,
an envelope, the page, pulsaret editor, etc.) of these systems, however,
required interpretative work, and it is here that UPIC, PG, and nuPG
incorporated a hermeneutical relation. In this perspective, all three can
be seen as compound devices extending the body, eye, ear, and mind, as
instruments impregnated with knowledge, which can serve as a model
of how our conceptions of what is musical material and form are being
constructed.

In the 1940s, British physicist Dennis Gabor proposed that all sounds can be
